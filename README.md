# Hello-World
First Repository

Wow, this is my first time using GitHub, first i thought i dont have to sign up, and then i realize, i need this website more and more, and i'm so curious to know more, i need to understan what people do in here.
I'm as generally category let say a newbie to programming and programming site like this one. I always think i'm not good enough for this kind of things, but i have chills when i see programming language and i want to know more. It excites me in kind of a way i can't explain.
I hope i can understand how GitHub works and people doin' in here.
